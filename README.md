# Shorter App

This is a tool to encode a URL and get a short URL.

## Running the Application
There are two ways to run the application:  
 - To run from the command line, use `mvn` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
 - Another way is to to run the `Application` class directly from your IDE.


#### Eclipse
- Right click on a project folder and select `Run As` --> `Maven build..` . After that a configuration window is opened.
- In the window set the value of the **Goals** field to `spring-boot:run` 
- You can optionally select `Skip tests` checkbox
- All the other settings can be left to default

Once configurations are set clicking `Run` will start the application
